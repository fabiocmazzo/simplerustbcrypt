# Rust Bcrypt Encoder

Hello folks! Welcome to the most magical, whimsical, and undeniably hilarious repository on GitHub. Buckle up because you're in for a _rustic_ ride with **Rust Bcrypt Encoder**.

## What is this marvelous tool?

Oh, I'm so glad you asked! This is no ordinary password hasher, my friends. Our Rust Bcrypt Encoder is as reliable as a wood-burning stove and twice as hot! It'll help you generate Bcrypt hashes faster than a squirrel on espresso. This tool is designed for my clients who are tired of relying on other tools or going online. Now you can generate hashes in the comfort of your terminal, wearing your comfy socks!

## How to use it?

Fear not, dear user! Operating our Bcrypt Encoder is easier than catching a greased pig at a county fair. Just input your password and the number of cost (bcrypt rounds), then sit back and watch the magic happen. Remember, if you're using this for a SpringBoot security application, the bcrypt round should be 10 by default. But hey, feel free to experiment, just don't blow anything up!

## License

This project is as free as a bird in the sky, covered by the MIT license. Yes, you heard it right! MIT, the same folks who gave us duct tape, the internet, and microwavable popcorn. Or was that someone else? ðŸ¤” Anyway, despite the simplicity, this tool has an open license because sharing is caring.

## Special Note

This project was developed by yours truly, Fabio Covolo Mazzo. If you're thinking, "wow, this is brilliant!" â€“ thanks, I know! If not... well, let's just say, comedy is subjective. ðŸ˜œ

Alright, that's it for now. Have fun hashing, and remember, a day without laughter is a day wasted.

Happy Encoding!
